Read and applied Neural Style Transfer paper from scratch in pytorch, a paper released in ___, that takes two images, 
Content Image(P) and Style Image(A) and generates an image(G) by keeping the semantic information of the content image 
and the style of the given style image. The paper uses a customized VGG-19 model(16 conv layers and 3 FC layers) and starts by 
passing P(content) , A(style) and X(noisey image), using backprop on P and X to get the noisey image close to content and 
similarly on A and X to get the noisey image close to style. As the loss is reduced time to time we get the better and better results
